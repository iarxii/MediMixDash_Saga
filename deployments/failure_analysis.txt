The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

- Relevant log lines
  - Build treats warnings as errors: [line 76](#L76)
  - ESLint failure (the actual blocking error): [line 83](#L83) which reports "React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'game.timeFreezeActive'". The failing file is src/Game.tsx (see repo file https://github.com/iarxii/MediMixDash_Saga/blob/main/src/Game.tsx).

Diagnosis
- The Create React App build is running in CI mode so warnings are treated as errors ([line 76](#L76)). ESLint reports a missing dependency in a useEffect in src/Game.tsx ([line 83](#L83)). That ESLint warning stops the build, causing Netlify to fail.

Cause
- A useEffect's dependency array is missing the value game.timeFreezeActive. ESLint's react-hooks/exhaustive-deps rule flags this as a problem. In CI (Netlify) this becomes a build error.

Solution
1. Fix the useEffect dependency list in src/Game.tsx
   - Edit src/Game.tsx and locate the useEffect around the reported location. Add game.timeFreezeActive to the dependency array so the effect correctly re-runs when that value changes.

   Example (TypeScript) — replace the existing effect’s dependency array with one that includes game.timeFreezeActive:
   ```ts
   useEffect(() => {
     // existing effect logic
     if (game.timeFreezeActive) {
       // ... do something when timeFreezeActive is true
     }
   }, [game.timeFreezeActive /*, otherExistingDeps */]);
   ```

   - If the effect also depends on other variables, include them in the array as well. Prefer listing specific primitives/fields (e.g., game.timeFreezeActive) rather than the whole game object to avoid unnecessary re-runs.

2. Alternatives (use with caution)
   - If you intentionally want the effect to run only once and understand the implications, you can silence the rule for that specific effect (not recommended unless you know why):
   ```ts
   // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
   useEffect(() => {
     // ...
   }, []);
   ```
   - Or refactor the logic so the effect uses a stable ref or callback and preserves correct behavior without disabling lint.

3. Rebuild
   - Commit and push the change. Netlify will re-run the build; the ESLint error should be resolved and the build should succeed.

Optional: change CI behavior (not recommended)
- You can make Netlify not treat warnings as errors by unsetting CI=true in the build environment (set CI to false in Netlify build environment variables). This only masks the underlying lint warning; fixing the dependency is the correct approach.

Files
- File to edit: src/Game.tsx — https://github.com/iarxii/MediMixDash_Saga/blob/main/src/Game.tsx

Summary
- Add game.timeFreezeActive to the useEffect dependency array (or properly refactor), commit, and push. This will fix the ESLint error that is failing the CI build.
