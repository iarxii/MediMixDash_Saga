The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

Diagnosis
- The build failed because ESLint warnings are treated as errors in CI ([line 77](#L77)), and the compiler stopped with ESLint errors in src/context/SoundContext.tsx: an unused variable and a missing hook dependency ([line 84](#L84), [line 85](#L85)).
- Relevant log lines: [line 77](#L77), [line 80](#L80)–[line 86](#L86).

Errors reported by ESLint
- "Line 119:19: 'targetVol' is assigned a value but never used" (in src/context/SoundContext.tsx) — unused variable causes an ESLint error ([line 84](#L84)).
- "Line 227:8: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'isPlaying'." — effect dependency array is incomplete ([line 85](#L85)).

File referenced: src/context/SoundContext.tsx — https://github.com/iarxii/MediMixDash_Saga/blob/main/src/context/SoundContext.tsx

Solution
1) Preferred: Fix the code (recommended)
  - Remove or use the unused variable targetVol at the source location (line referenced by ESLint). If it was left from a refactor, delete the declaration; otherwise, actually use it.
    Example: if the file currently has something like
```typescript
const targetVol = someCalculation(); // unused — remove or use
```
    remove the line, or use targetVol in code so it isn't flagged.

  - Fix the useEffect dependency error by including isPlaying in the dependency array (or restructure the effect).
    Example change:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // effect body that depends on isPlaying
}, [isPlaying /*, other deps used inside the effect */]);
```
    If you truly intend the effect to run only once and have considered the consequences, you may explicitly silence the rule for that line (not recommended unless you understand the hook behavior):
```typescript
// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
useEffect(() => {
  // effect body
}, []);
```
    But prefer adding the missing dependency or refactoring the effect (e.g., using refs or splitting effects).

  - Commit and push the fixes to the repo, then trigger a Netlify deploy again.

2) Alternative (not recommended): stop treating warnings as errors on Netlify
  - Netlify sets CI=true which makes CRA fail on ESLint warnings ([line 77](#L77)). You can change the environment variable CI to false in Netlify Build & Deploy > Environment > Edit variables (set CI = false). This will allow the build to succeed despite ESLint warnings, but it hides real issues — better to fix the code.

Notes
- You should edit src/context/SoundContext.tsx at the linked path above and correct the two issues, then rebuild.
- After fixing, run locally: npm run build (or set CI=true locally when testing to replicate Netlify behavior).
