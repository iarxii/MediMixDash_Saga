## **2. Core Gameplay Mechanics**

*   **Primary Objective:**  
    Match medications on a **Candy Crush-style grid** to assemble pill packs for patients waiting in the seating area. Fulfill prescription orders accurately and quickly to maintain high morale and earn rewards.

*   **How It Works:**
    *   Players swap medication tiles to create **matches of 3 or more**.
    *   Each match generates a **pill count** that fills prescriptions for patient sprites in the seating area.
    *   Patients have a **Waiting Time bar**—dispense their meds before time runs out!
    *   **Prescription Orders:** Each patient has a specific order (e.g., 5 Gelux, 2 Pillora, 1 Injecta). Match exactly or risk penalties for over/under dispensing.
    *   **Over-Dispensing Penalty:** Extra pills beyond the order deduct -1 Dash Points per extra pill.
    *   **Under-Dispensing/Failure:** Failing to fulfill an order fully results in penalties (e.g., -5 Dash Points, +1 Complaint).
    *   **Morale System:** Dispensing speed affects patient lineup morale.
        *   **Fast Dispensing:** Increases morale (+1 Compliment, slightly increased timers for future patients).
        *   **Slow Dispensing:** Decreases morale or stagnates it (+1 Complaint, reduced timers for future patients).

*   **Level Progression:**
    *   Increasing complexity: more medication types, faster timers, special prescriptions.
    *   Unlock new pharmacy counters and themes as you progress.

*   **Scoring System:**
    *   **Dash Points:** Earned for each successful dispense. Penalties for over/under dispensing or failures.
    *   **Currency:** Earned based on work fulfilled during in-game shifts (e.g., 5-minute runs). Currency can be used for upgrades or cosmetics.
    *   Bonus for **combo matches** and **speed dispensing**.

*   **Special Features:**
    *   **Power-Ups:** "Turbo Dispenser" (fills all prescriptions instantly), "Time Freeze" (pauses timers).
    *   **Chain Reactions:** Matching 4 or 5 meds creates special capsules that clear rows or columns.
    *   **Morale Meter:** Tracks overall patient satisfaction, affecting gameplay difficulty.
